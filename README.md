<b>Communication plan:</b>
A combination of biweekly Zoom meetings/in-person library sessions.
Building the project in stages through branch creation and commits.

<b>Business Opportunity:</b>
Predicting whether or not a customer will repay the loan that he takes can not only detect patterns in the factors affecting customers likely or unlikely to repay them, but also inspire strategic decisions to maximize loan repayment in the future and help prepare for them today.

<b>Data source:</b> Dataset generated by Amazon canvas-sample-loans.csv referenced in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas-sample-datasets.html

<b>Research Objectives and Questions:</b>

<i>Descriptive:</i>
1. How does the loan amount vary with loan repayment status?
2. What is the most and least important factor affecting loan repayment status?
3. How does the interest rate vary with the purpose of taking the loan? What other factors influence interest rate and by how much? How does that, in turn, affect loan repayment status?

<i>Predictive:</i>
1. Is a new customer likely to repay the loan taken or not? With how much certainty/accuracy can we predict this?
